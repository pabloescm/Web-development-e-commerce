# Web development
A web page made for a ecommerce using the following :

- html
- css
- javascript
- nodejs
- postgresql

To run the complete web application you will the three parts:

Cliente (This)
Api (will soon upload)
database (will soon upload)

The client connect to the api with the HTTP protocol and the api communicate with the data base which have all the necesary information to fulfill the client and the webpage its self with all the necesary information like the images of all the products (images are stored in the database) for example.

note(No framework used for the frontend pure html css and javascript for DOM manipulation)

This is the cliente part of the development where I structure the page using html,
and with the help of css the style of the web page, I use a mobile first approach for the responsive part of the webpage. The proyect have a puclic client side and also have an a private administrator side were you can manage all your ecommerce products , clients ,categories etc.
