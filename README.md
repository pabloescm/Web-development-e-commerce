# Web development
A web page made for a ecommerce using the following :

- html
- css
- javascript
- nodejs
- postgresql

To run the complete application you will the three parts:

Cliente (This)
Api (will soon upload)
database (will soon upload)

The client connect to the api with the HTTP protocol and the api connect to the data base which have all the necesary information to fulfill the client and the webpage its self with all the necesary information like the images of all the products (link are stored in the database) for example.

note(No framework used for the frontend)

This is the cliente part of the development where we structure the page using html,
and with the help of css the style of the web page, i use a mobile first approach for the responsive part if the webpage. The proyect have a client side and also have an administrator side were you can manage all your products , clients ,categories etc.
